* Various code cleanups for fq_codel

* Generic Issues
** TODO Correct solution for queues that might not return a packet

Not clear if this problem is generic to the net point-to-point device
or global.

** TODO Correct solution for tcp initial sequence numbers

** TODO the Ipv4Header and the Ipv6Header objects do not have equivalent functions like getECN. 

* FQ_Codel
** DONE Fix Incorrect hashing for number of flows

std::size_t
Fq_CoDelQueue::hash(Ptr<Packet> p)
arbitrarily constrains the range of queue hashes to 768 instead of m_divisor
                       & 0x2ff);
			^^^^^^

created m_flows and % that.

** TODO Fix Incorrect hashing for IPv6 and other protocols
Linux abstracted all this out into net/core/flow-dissector.c

It also inspects deep enough to get src/dst ports from many
popular protocols.

Switching to the same jhash will also get rid of a dependency
on boost.

ns3 Header parsing is weird. Declare the object, see if it exists?

q->PeekHeader(each kind of ip header? tcp, udp, sctp?)
if header->hasports()?

** TODO fq_codel does not use shared buffer backlog on the codel aqm

That was how we did things prior to running into the horizontal standing queue problem.


  if (m_ht[h] == NULL)
    {
      NS_LOG_DEBUG ("fq_codel enqueue Create queue " << h);
      m_ht[h] = new Fq_CoDelSlot ();
      slot = m_ht[h];
      slot->q->backlog = &backlog;

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^?
      slot->h = h;
    }


(and to this day I'm dissatisfied with the solution in linux. We drop a lot more sparse packets now  than I'd like)

** TODO Fq_CoDelQueue::DoEnqueue (Ptr<Packet> p) looks a lot like sfq in initializing queues.

It seems saner to me to initialize once at startup. Don't need a map, either, just a good ole fashioned array...

** TODO fq_codel initializes the perturbation value at instantation time.

It is not swept every so often as in SFQ.

** TODO Add IPv6 support
** TODO Add ECN support

** DONE Uses a quantum of 4700 by default - switch back to 1500 default
Fiddling with larger quantums on wifi at the time made some sense.
but a single MTU or 300 are more commonly used. 

** Add support for codel and fq_codel variants

* SFQ
** DONE Uses a quantum of 4500 by default - switch back to 1500 default
** DONE fix speling of peturbation 
** TODO Change to timed, rather than per-packet perturbation interval as per linux
** TODO Add IPv6 support
** TODO Add ECN support
** TODO add depth and flows options

* TODO ARED
* TODO SFQRED and SFQARED
* Documentation
* Tests
* DNS model
* Cablelabs stuff
* RRUL test emulation
  isochronous voip streams
  4 up 4 down tcp
